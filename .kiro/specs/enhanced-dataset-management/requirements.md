# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current dataset management system allows users to upload and view datasets, but lacks essential functionality for a complete data platform experience. Users need the ability to download datasets, have clear documentation of data structures, and better management capabilities. This enhancement will transform the basic dataset handling into a comprehensive dataset management system with proper documentation, download capabilities, and improved user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to download datasets that I have access to, so that I can work with the data locally or in external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a dataset they have access to THEN the system SHALL display a download button
2. WHEN a user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL provide the dataset in its original format
3. WHEN a user downloads a dataset THEN the system SHALL log the download activity for audit purposes
4. IF a dataset is shared with limited permissions THEN the system SHALL respect download restrictions based on sharing settings
5. WHEN a download is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide progress indication for large files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to see comprehensive documentation of dataset structures and metadata, so that I can understand the data before working with it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a dataset THEN the system SHALL display column names, data types, and sample values
2. WHEN dataset metadata is available THEN the system SHALL show file size, row count, and upload timestamp
3. WHEN a dataset has missing values THEN the system SHALL indicate null/empty value statistics per column
4. WHEN a user views dataset documentation THEN the system SHALL show data quality metrics and basic statistics
5. IF a dataset has been processed or transformed THEN the system SHALL document the transformation history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to control dataset download permissions, so that I can manage data access and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin configures dataset sharing THEN the system SHALL allow setting download permissions separately from view permissions
2. WHEN a dataset has restricted download access THEN the system SHALL hide download options for unauthorized users
3. WHEN download permissions are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new restrictions
4. WHEN a user attempts unauthorized download THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. IF an organization has download policies THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-level download restrictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data owner, I want to track who downloads my datasets and when, so that I can monitor data usage and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dataset is downloaded THEN the system SHALL record the user, timestamp, and dataset information
2. WHEN a data owner views their dataset THEN the system SHALL display download history and statistics
3. WHEN multiple downloads occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate download metrics by user and time period
4. WHEN download tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide exportable download reports
5. IF a dataset is shared publicly THEN the system SHALL still track anonymous download statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the platform, I want programmatic access to dataset downloads via API, so that I can automate data workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated API request is made for dataset download THEN the system SHALL provide the dataset file
2. WHEN API download is requested THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions same as web interface
3. WHEN API download occurs THEN the system SHALL apply the same logging and tracking as web downloads
4. WHEN large datasets are requested via API THEN the system SHALL support streaming downloads
5. IF API rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce download rate limiting per user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to preview dataset structure and content before downloading, so that I can verify it meets my needs without downloading large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a dataset THEN the system SHALL display the first 10-20 rows as a preview
2. WHEN dataset preview is shown THEN the system SHALL include column headers and data types
3. WHEN a dataset is large THEN the system SHALL provide preview without loading the entire file
4. WHEN preview data is displayed THEN the system SHALL indicate if data is truncated or sampled
5. IF a dataset has multiple sheets or tables THEN the system SHALL allow previewing different sections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear error handling and feedback during download operations, so that I understand any issues and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a download fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
2. WHEN a download is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resumable downloads where possible
3. WHEN insufficient permissions exist THEN the system SHALL explain the specific permission requirements
4. WHEN a dataset is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest alternatives
5. IF download quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform users of limits and reset times
