# AI Share Platform with Next.js & FastAPI - Updated TODO

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTICE: MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED**

**Status**: The recent major updates (MindsDB integration, dataset chat, project reorganization) have **NOT been manually tested**. While the code has been structured and integrated, comprehensive manual testing is required before production deployment.

**Key Areas Requiring Manual Testing**:
- üß™ MindsDB Google Gemini integration and model creation
- üí¨ Dataset chat functionality (`/datasets/[id]/chat`)
- üìä Real-time dataset listing and upload functionality
- üîÑ Automatic ML model generation for uploaded datasets
- üîí Environment file security and configuration
- üìÅ File organization and backup systems

**Recommendation**: Run comprehensive testing suite and manual verification before deploying to production.
