# Secure Proxy Connector System

## Overview

The Secure Proxy Connector System is an advanced enhancement that transforms the simplified connector system into a comprehensive proxy solution. This system acts as a secure intermediary that completely hides real URLs, credentials, and connection details from users while providing seamless access to shared resources, APIs, and databases.

## üéØ Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è **Complete Security & Privacy**
- **Hidden Credentials**: Real connection details and credentials are encrypted and never exposed to users
- **Proxy URLs**: Users only see proxy URLs (e.g., `/proxy/px_abc123`) instead of real endpoints
- **Secure Vault**: Encrypted credential storage with enterprise-grade security
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all proxy operations

### üîó **Shared Link Management**
- **Secure Sharing**: Create shareable links that provide controlled access to proxy connectors
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions with user allowlists and authentication requirements
- **Expiration & Limits**: Set time-based expiration and usage limits for shared links
- **Public/Private Options**: Choose between public access or restricted private sharing

### üåê **Third-Party Integration**
- **API Gateway**: Secure proxy for third-party API access without exposing endpoints
- **Database Proxy**: Controlled database access with hidden connection strings
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any service that accepts URL-based connections

### üë• **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Simplified Access**: Users interact through clean proxy interfaces without technical complexity
- **No Credential Management**: Users never handle or see sensitive connection information
- **Seamless Integration**: Proxy URLs work directly with third-party applications and tools

    real_config = self.decrypt_credentials(proxy.real_connection_config)
    real_credentials = self.decrypt_credentials(proxy.real_credentials)
    
    # Execute operation with real credentials
    result = await self._execute_operation(real_config, real_credentials, operation_data)
    
    # Log access and return result
    await self._log_proxy_access(proxy_id, operation_type, result)
    return result

async def validate_shared_link_access(
    self,
    share_id: str,
    user_id: Optional[int] = None
