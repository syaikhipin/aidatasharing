# Access Request System Enhancement Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Startup Error
**Problem**: The application was failing to start with the error:
```
Error initializing database: When initializing mapper Mapper[Organization(organizations)], expression 'ProxyConnector' failed to locate a name ('ProxyConnector'). If this is a class name, consider adding this relationship() to the <class 'app.models.organization.Organization'> class after both dependent classes have been defined.
```

**Solution**: 
- Added missing model imports in `backend/app/core/create_schema.py`
- Imported `ProxyConnector`, `SharedProxyLink`, `ProxyAccessLog`, `ProxyCredentialVault` from `app.models.proxy_connector`
- Imported `ConfigurationOverride`, `MindsDBConfiguration`, `ConfigurationHistory` from `app.models.admin_config`
- Removed non-existent `Department` model references

### 2. Access Request System Improvements
**Problem**: The access request feature existed but had a poor user experience with basic prompts and limited functionality.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive access request system with:

#### Backend Enhancements
- Added missing notification endpoints:
  - `PATCH /api/data-access/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all notifications as read
  - `DELETE /api/data-access/notifications/{notification_id}` - Delete a notification
- Enhanced existing access request API endpoints

#### Frontend Enhancements
- **Enhanced Access Request Form** (`frontend/src/components/datasets/AccessRequestForm.tsx`):
  - Professional modal-based form instead of basic prompts
  - Comprehensive validation with real-time feedback
  - Multiple access levels (read, write, admin)
  - Request categories (research, analysis, compliance, reporting, development)
  - Urgency levels (low, medium, high)
  - Optional expiry date selection
  - Detailed purpose and justification fields

- **Notification Center** (`frontend/src/components/datasets/NotificationCenter.tsx`):
  - Real-time notification display
  - Filter by type (all, unread, access requests)
  - Mark individual or all notifications as read
  - Delete notifications
  - Visual indicators for different notification types
  - Professional UI with proper styling

- **Enhanced Data Access Page** (`frontend/src/app/data-access/page.tsx`):
  - Added notifications tab to the existing browse and requests tabs
  - Integrated the new access request modal
  - Improved user experience with better visual feedback

- **Admin Access Request Management** (`frontend/src/app/admin/access-requests/page.tsx`):
  - Dedicated admin interface for managing access requests
  - Filter requests by status (pending, approved, rejected, all)
  - Detailed request information display
  - Approve/reject functionality with reason notes
  - Professional admin interface with proper styling

#### API Client Updates
- Added notification management endpoints to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Updated HTTP methods to match backend implementation (PATCH instead of PUT)
